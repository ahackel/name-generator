# name-generator

A name generator written in javascript. It can generate (mostly) German names and variations of these. I created it to find a name for my son.

[Run Name Generator](https://andreashackel.de/name-generator)

## Usage

Just click **"New Name"**. By default it generates just random names. Alternatively enter a name into **"Template Name"**. Then the generator will create variations of this name.

If you like one of the generated names but want to create more variations of it just click it and it becomes the new template name.

## Favorites

Click the star in front of a name to make it a favorite. Favorite names stay in the list when you reload the page.

## Edit the source list

You can enter your own source names into **parts.txt**. Each line contains a single name split into syllables.
