# name-generator

A name generator written in javascript. It can generate (mostly) German names and variations of these. I created it to find a name for my son.

## Usage

Just click *"New Name"*. By default it generates just random names. Alternatively enter a name into *"Template"*. Then the generator will create variations of this name.
